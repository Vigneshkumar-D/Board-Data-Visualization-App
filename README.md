# Google Authentication and Responsive Dashboard

Welcome to the Google Authentication and Responsive Dashboard project! This endeavor focuses on crafting a comprehensive authentication system via Google for both user login and signup processes. Additionally, our goal involves creating an adaptable and visually appealing dashboard that mirrors the provided design. This dashboard will be populated with functional charts, displaying illustrative dummy data. The entire project is developed using Next.js and employs the NextAuth.js library for the authentication mechanism.

## Dashboard

The dashboard creation is focused on meticulous attention to detail. We aim to replicate the provided design with pixel-perfection, thereby offering users an aesthetically pleasing interface. This interface dynamically adapts to various screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience. To enhance the utility of the dashboard, functional charts are incorporated, showcasing dummy data for an informative display.

## Getting Started

To immerse yourself in the project, here are the initial steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure Google authentication credentials in accordance with NextAuth.js documentation.
4. Initiate the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Access the project via your preferred browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## Design

Our design closely aligns with the vision depicted in the Figma design. We encourage skillful adaptation of the design to ensure responsiveness across diverse screen dimensions and devices. The Figma design is accessible through this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/gKLhBDaTmdNDzHjsvqFMmC/Front-End-Developer-Task?node-id=0-1&t=rJ4A60cFvrDoc5TE-0).

## Deployment

We would like to notify you that, due to technical complications, the Google authentication functionality has not been deployed in the current version of the project. We are actively addressing this issue and are committed to delivering a comprehensive and fully functional solution in future updates.
